# 1. Problem 
This benchmark uses a RNN to classify images. This is a fork of https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/official/resnet. 


## Disclaimer

The current timing scripts do not time all of the data pre-processing. The preprocessing done as described in the dataset section is not included in the timing. [Some of the preprocessing](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/official/resnet/imagenet_preprocessing.py), though, is including in the timing. This is an artifact of the difficulty and lack of automation in the data processing and downloading and will be remedied in the future.

### Steps to configure machine

To setup the environment on Ubuntu 16.04 (16 CPUs, one P100, 100 GB disk), you can use these commands. This may vary on a different operating system or graphics card.

    # Install docker

### Steps to download and verify data
Unfortunately data downloading and preprocess is a somewhat cumbersome process. Please refer to the instructions here:

https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/inception#getting-started


### Steps to run and time

We assume that imagenet pre-processed has already been mounted at `/imn`. 

    cd ~/reference/image_classification/tensorflow/
    IMAGE=`sudo docker build . | tail -n 1 | awk '{print $3}'`
    SEED=2
    NOW=`date "+%F-%T"`
    sudo docker run -v /imn:/imn --runtime=nvidia -t -i $IMAGE "./run_and_time.sh" $SEED | tee benchmark-$NOW.log

For reference, 

    $ ls /imn
    imagenet  lost+found

# 3. Dataset/Environment
### Publication/Attribution
We use Imagenet (http://image-net.org/):

    Z. Huang, A. Karpathy, A. Khosla, M. Bernstein, et al. Imagenet
    large scale visual recognition challenge. arXiv:1409.0575, 2014.


### Data preprocessing
The dataset is extensively preprocessed, in several ways including image processing and, batching and TF formatting. The first pass does conversion and scaling (e.g. png to jpg). The second step is to group images in larger groups and convert into a Tensorflow format. There is also cropping and augmentation, mean color subtraction, bounding boxes etc.

For more information on preprocessing, see this file and documentation:
https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/inception#getting-started

### Training and test data separation
This is proivded by the imagenet dataset and original authors.

### Training data order
Each epoch goes over all the training data, shuffled every epoch.  

### Test data order
We use all the data for evaluation. We don't provide an order for of data traversal for evaluation.

### Publication/Attribution

See the following papers for more background:

### Structure & Loss

In brief, this is a 50 layer v1 RNN. Refer to [Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.03385.pdf) for the layer structure and loss function.


### Weight and bias initialization

Weight initialization is done as described here in [Delving Deep into Rectifiers: Surpassing Human-Level Performance on ImageNet Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.01852).


### Optimizer
We use a SGD Momentum based optimizer. The momentum and learning rate are scaled based on the batch size. 


# 5. Quality
### Quality metric
Percent of correct classifications on the Image Net test dataset. 

### Quality target
We run to 0.749 accuracy (74.9% correct classifications). 

### Evaluation frequency
We evaluate after every epoch.

### Evaluation thoroughness
Every test exmaple is used each time.
