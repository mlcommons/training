# Tensorflow Object Detection API
Creating accurate machine learning models capable of localizing and identifying
multiple objects in a single image remains a core challenge in computer vision.
The TensorFlow Object Detection API is an open source framework built on top of
TensorFlow that makes it easy to construct, train and deploy object detection
models.  At Google weâ€™ve certainly found this codebase to be useful for our
computer vision needs, and we hope that you will as well.

Contributions to the codebase are welcome and we would love to hear back from
you if you find this API useful.  Finally if you use the Tensorflow Object
Detection API for a research publication, please consider citing:

## Release information

### April 30, 2018

We have released a Faster R-CNN detector with ResNet-101 feature extractor trained on [AVA](https://research.google.com/ava/) v2.1.
Compared with other commonly used object detectors, it changes the action classification loss function to per-class Sigmoid loss to handle boxes with multiple labels.
The model is trained on the training split of AVA v2.1 for 1.5M iterations, it achieves mean AP of 11.25% over 60 classes on the validation split of AVA v2.1.
For more details please refer to this [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.08421).

<b>Thanks to contributors</b>: Chen Sun, David Ross

### April 2, 2018

Supercharge your mobile phones with the next generation mobile object detector!
We are adding support for MobileNet V2 with SSDLite presented in
[MobileNetV2: Inverted Residuals and Linear Bottlenecks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.04381).
This model is 35% faster than Mobilenet V1 SSD on a Google Pixel phone CPU (200ms vs. 270ms) at the same accuracy.
Along with the model definition, we are also releasing a model checkpoint trained on the COCO dataset.

<b>Thanks to contributors</b>: Menglong Zhu, Mark Sandler, Zhichao Lu, Vivek Rathod, Jonathan Huang

### February 9, 2018

We now support instance segmentation!!  In this API update we support a number of instance segmentation models similar to those discussed in the [Mask R-CNN paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06870). For further details refer to
[our slides](http://presentations.cocodataset.org/Places17-GMRI.pdf) from the 2017 Coco + Places Workshop.
Refer to the section on [Running an Instance Segmentation Model](g3doc/instance_segmentation.md) for instructions on how to configure a model
that predicts masks in addition to object bounding boxes.

<b>Thanks to contributors</b>: Alireza Fathi, Zhichao Lu, Vivek Rathod, Ronny Votel, Jonathan Huang

### November 17, 2017

As a part of the Open Images V3 release we have released:

* An implementation of the Open Images evaluation metric and the [protocol](g3doc/evaluation_protocols.md#open-images).
* Additional tools to separate inference of detection and evaluation (see [this tutorial](g3doc/oid_inference_and_evaluation.md)).
* A new detection model trained on the Open Images V2 data release (see [Open Images model](g3doc/detection_model_zoo.md#open-images-models)).

See more information on the [Open Images website](https://github.com/openimages/dataset)!

<b>Thanks to contributors</b>: Stefan Popov, Alina Kuznetsova

### November 6, 2017

We have re-released faster versions of our (pre-trained) models in the
<a href='g3doc/detection_model_zoo.md'>model zoo</a>.  In addition to what
was available before, we are also adding Faster R-CNN models trained on COCO
with Inception V2 and Resnet-50 feature extractors, as well as a Faster R-CNN
with Resnet-101 model trained on the KITTI dataset.

<b>Thanks to contributors</b>: Jonathan Huang, Vivek Rathod, Derek Chow,
Tal Remez, Chen Sun.

### October 31, 2017

We have released a new state-of-the-art model for object detection using
the Faster-RCNN with the
[NASNet-A image featurization](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.07012). This
model achieves mAP of 43.1% on the test-dev validation dataset for COCO,
improving on the best available model in the zoo by 6% in terms
of absolute mAP.

<b>Thanks to contributors</b>: Barret Zoph, Vijay Vasudevan, Jonathon Shlens, Quoc Le

### August 11, 2017

We have released an update to the [Android Detect
demo](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/examples/android)
which will now run models trained using the Tensorflow Object
Detection API on an Android device.  By default, it currently runs a
frozen SSD w/Mobilenet detector trained on COCO, but we encourage
you to try out other detection models!

<b>Thanks to contributors</b>: Jonathan Huang, Andrew Harp
