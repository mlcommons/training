# Some of the Bazel rules used to precompile TensorFlow don't respect Bazel's
# "manual" tag. The following hack prevents Bazel from compiling TensorFlow
# from source when executing a command such as: bazel test cc/...
test //cc/... -- -//cc/tensorflow/...

# These .bazelrc files are generated by the cc/configure_tensorflow.sh script.
